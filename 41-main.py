# if __name__ == __main__ : (this script can be imported OR run standalone)
#                           Funcitons and classes in this module can be reused
#                           without the main block of code executing

# Good practice (code is modular
#                helps readability
#                leaves no global variable 
#                avoid unitended execution )

#   ex. library = Import library for functionality
#                 When running library directly, display a help page
#   look at 41 folder as example
